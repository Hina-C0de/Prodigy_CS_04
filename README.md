# **Simple Keylogger**
Keylogger is program used to record every keystroke made on a keyboard. It is used for monitoring, security audits and debugging.

## Overview
This Python keylogger records keystrokes and logs them into a file (key_log.txt).   
It captures both printable characters and special keys while running in the background.    
The logging session starts with a timestamp and stops when the ESC key is pressed.
